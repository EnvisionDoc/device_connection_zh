EnOS Device Protocol Standard
==============================

EnOS provides device SDKs for you to configure devices. These device SDKs already encapsulate protocols for data exchange between devices and EnOS Cloud.Â 

When the device SDKs provided by EnOS cannot meet your requirements, you can refer to the Device Protocol Standard to develop your own communication protocol based on the EnOS device protocol standard. You can connect your devices into EnOS as long as your data format conforms to the standard.
